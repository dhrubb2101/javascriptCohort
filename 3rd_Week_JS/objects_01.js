//objects represents the real world entities
//everything are a real world entity 
//and those entities have properties and methods
//for example a car is a real world entity
//and it has properties like color, model, brand, etc.

//objects have properties and methods
//properties are the attributes of the objects 
//like color, model, brand, etc.
//Methods are the actions,functions that the object can perform
//like start, stop, accelerate, etc.

//What is the difference between an function and method
//There's no actual difference between a function and a method
//A method is a function that is associated with an object
//So when we say method, we mean a function that is associated with an object
//So when we say function, we mean a standalone function
