//here what's happening is we are creating a proxy object of the original array
//and we are intercepting the get and set methods of that array
//so whenever we do arr[1] = 111, it will call the set method of the proxy
//and we can modify the value before setting it to the original array
//similarly, whenever we do arr[1], it will call the get method of the proxy
//and we can modify the value before returning it

//so here what we did when we called the function enableNegativeIndexing we store it in a variable called proxyArr
//and whenever we do proxyArr[1] = 111, it will call the set method of the proxy
//and we are adding a star emoji to the value before setting it to the original array
//similarly, whenever we do proxyArr[1], it will call the get method of the proxy
//and we can modify the value before returning it

//and why the original array is also getting updated because we are modifying the original array in the set method of the proxy
//because as you can see the parameter passed targetArr is the address reference of the original array 
//so whenever we do target[prop] = value, we are modifying the original array
//hence both the original array and the proxy array are getting updated
