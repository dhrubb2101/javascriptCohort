Check the node version first when creating a full stack project

You run the js code using commands
node filename.js
bun filename.js

Though we'll beusing just node for now

we tested a js filename.js file using node command in terminal

Then install the npm package manager using
npm init -y
y here indicates yes to all the default questions

We are not looking at the structure of the project first 

but seeing can we even do the project at the first place

Then decide the entry point of the project

here by default it is index.js

You see it when you pass the command npm init

//===================================================================

now when you began to create the files for the fullstack project

we start with file that is defined as the entry point of the project
here in this case it is index.js

//===================================================================
