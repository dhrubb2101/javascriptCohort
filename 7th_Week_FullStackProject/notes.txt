Check the node version first when creating a full stack project

You run the js code using commands
node filename.js
bun filename.js

Though we'll beusing just node for now

we tested a js filename.js file using node command in terminal

Then install the npm package manager using
npm init -y
y here indicates yes to all the default questions

We are not looking at the structure of the project first 

but seeing can we even do the project at the first place

Then decide the entry point of the project

here by default it is index.js

You see it when you pass the command npm init

//===================================================================

now when you began to create the files for the fullstack project

we start with file that is defined as the entry point of the project
here in this case it is index.js

//===================================================================

-we use third party libraries in our code to get some code functionality
-so they are two instances one is
-require
-import
-to use require we need to set the type of the project as commonjs in package.json file
-we can also use import but for that we need to set the type of the project as module in package.json file
-they just bring the data from another file to the current file
-we'll use module here

//===================================================================

-you can see the critical structure of the project
-you can see it in env file or env.sample file
-like what is happening in the project , what services are being used in the project and what database is being used in the project

//===================================================================

there is a platform called render
//where you host your fullstack project for free
//there you add your environment variables 
in env file we database password and other or openAI API keys, Razorpay username and password etc
all these are sensitive data
what mail services are being used in the project
what payment gateway is being used in the project
all these are mentioned in the env file
you push the env file directly to serber or you push the env.sample file to the server

//===================================================================

Now next step is 
there's a client and a server
client sends request to the server
server processes the request and sends back the response to the client
client will request at /
and server will respond with a message "cohort"
so we create a server using express framework
//express is a third party library

//===================================================================

next step is to install express framework using
npm install express

//===================================================================

if you want to see what libraries and dependencies are installed in your project
you can see it in package.json file and package-lock.json file
you can see the packages in the dependencies object in package.json file

//===================================================================

go to index.js and copy the express code
//here command require is being used 
instead we use import command
import express from 'express';
and remove the require command
which is 
const express = require('express');

here express as a function is being called and the return value is stored in the app variable
const app = express();
express ki saari shakti app ko transfer ho rhi hai 

Then we give a port number to the server to listen to the requests
const PORT = 3000;
//===================================================================

Then we install 
npm install nodemon
npm install nodemon --save-dev
//--save-dev means it is a dev dependency
//it is used in the development phase of the project
//it is not used in the production phase of the project

//it monitors the node and whenever there is need it reloads it
//====================================================================

Then we go to package.json file and add a script to start the server using nodemon
"scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon index.js"
  },

//===================================================================

//the dependencies that are installed in package.json are crucial dependencies for
//development dependencies are those which are used in the development phase of the project
//command for them is 
npm i -D nodemon

//===================================================================

now we'll run the project by command
npm run start
and the last word here is start we can change that any other word in "scripts" object in package.json file
and then use that in command

//===================================================================

go to .env file
then write PORT in env file 
then we download the dotenv package using
npm install dotenv
//it helps us to read the env file and set the environment variables in the process.env object

//===================================================================

then we go to index.js file and import dotenv package   
import dotenv from "dotenv"
dotenv.config()
//it reads the env file and sets the environment variables in the process.env object

//===================================================================

//use of process.env.PORT (you define port accordingly) in index.js

//===================================================================

user first send request to frontend (client)
then frontend sends request to backend (server)
then backend processes the request and sends back the response to the frontend (client)
then frontend shows the response to the user

//===================================================================

//CORS Error
//CORS means Cross Origin Resource Sharing
//it is a security feature implemented by browsers to prevent malicious websites from accessing resources on other websites
//when the frontend and backend are on different domains or ports, the browser considers them as different origins
//so when the frontend sends a request to the backend, the browser blocks the request and shows a CORS error
//to fix this error, we need to enable CORS on the backend
//we can do this by using the cors package
//we can install it using npm install cors  

//===================================================================

app.use(cors());
//it enables CORS for all routes and origins
//if you want to enable CORS for specific routes or origins, you can pass options to the cors function
//like this
app.use(cors({ origin: 'http://example.com' }));
//it enables CORS for the route /api
//cors basically allows the frontend to access the backend resources
//that is cors sirf ussi frontend ko access dena chah rha hai jiska url humne cors me dia hai for it to accessed in the backend

//===================================================================

//now there's a new problem

//we want to send data {"name": "hitesh"} from frontend to backend
//until now we were sending only web requests from backend to frontend

//===================================================================

//now we have no issue if backend directly communicates with the database
//in first iteration we'll be using  mongodb then we will be using postgreSQL
//to talk to mongodb we'll be using mongoose package which will in turn talk to mongodb

//===================================================================

we'll be creating utils.js file in which we will be creating a function to connect to the database
//then we will be exporting that function to index.js file and calling it in index.js file
